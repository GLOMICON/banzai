Bioinformatics Summary:


After sequences were demultiplexed by the sequencing facility on the basis of the ligated (library) index, we merged forward and reverse paired-end reads and performed quality control using PEAR (pear --help | grep 'PEAR v' latex:\cite{Zhang2014}).

Reads were discarded if more than "$UNCALLEDMAX" of its bases were uncalled, 

If a read contained two consecutive base calls with quality scores less than "$Quality_Threshold" (i.e. probability of incorrect base call = XXX), these bases and all subsequent bases were removed from the read before merging. 


Read alignments were scored using the 
if [ "$SCORING" == 2 ] then;
	echo "assembly scoring method, using +1 for match and -1 for mismatch, multiplied by base quality scores."
fi
if [ "$SCORING" == 1 ] then;
	echo "observed expected alignment scores with +1 for match and -1 for mismatch."
fi

Merged reads were assessed for statistical significance using 
if [ "$TEST" == 1 ] then;
	echo "observed expected alignment scores"
fi
if [ "$TEST" == 2 ] then;
	echo "maximal acceptance probability"
fi

and merged reads with a p-value greater than $PVALUE were discarded


                                        
Forward and reverse reads were merged using PEAR v0.9.4 \cite{Zhang2014} and discarded if more than 0.01 of the bases were uncalled. If a read contained two consecutive base calls with quality scores less than 15 (i.e. probability of incorrect base call = 0.0316), these bases and all subsequent bases were removed from the read. 

Paired reads for which the probability of matching by chance alone exceeded 0.01 were not assembled and omitted from the analysis. 

Assembled reads were discarded if assembled sequences were not between 50 and 168 bp long, or if reads did not overlap by at least 100 bp.


Merged reads were discarded if the sum of the per-base error probabilities was greater than 0.5 (``expected errors'' USEARCH v7.0.1090 \cite{Edgar2010}. Sequences were demultiplexed on the basis of the 6bp index sequence at base positions 4-9 at both ends using the programming language AWK. Primer sequences were removed using cutadapt v1.7.1 \cite{Martin2011}, allowing for 2 mismatches in the primer sequence. To speed up subsequent clustering, identical sequences were consolidated in python. Singleton sequences were removed. Sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using usearch v7.0.1090 with a clustering radius of 1\%, and chimeric sequences were removed \cite{Edgar2010}. The final data are thus a matrix of counts of OTUs present in each sample.


CONTROLS
========
We included negative controls for the filtration process by filtering a volume of deionized water equal to that used for the environmental samples.
We included negative controls for the PCR process by conducting PCRs using deionized water in place of template alongside the target samples.

We tested for amplification of both the filtration and PCR negative controls by running their PCR products on an agarose gel. XXX of YYY filtration negative controls produced visible bands, and XXX of YYY PCR negative controls produced visible products. We sequenced XXX of the filtration negative controls and XXX of the PCR negative controls.



CONTAMINATION
=============

The sequencing run consisted of X libraries, each of which contained (min, mean, max?) samples distinguished by primer index. We calculated the rate of contamination in two directions: reads belonging to the positive control taxon in non-control samples, and reads in control samples that do NOT belong to the control taxon. 

proportion of reads assigned to the positive control taxon in non-control samples.
